## 🚀 How It Works

### **User Flow:**

1. **Click Search Bar** → Dropdown opens with recent/popular searches
2. **Start Typing** → Live results appear (300ms debounce)
3. **See Results** → Up to 8 property cards with full details
4. **Click Property** → Navigate to property details page
5. **Click "View All"** → Navigate to browse page with search query
6. **Press Enter** → Execute search and navigate

### **Search Algorithm:**

```typescript
// Multi-field search
const searchableText = [
  title, description, address, city, state, 
  zip_code, property_type, features
].join(' ').toLowerCase();

// Price matching
if (query includes "under" or "below") → filter by max price
if (query includes "over" or "above") → filter by min price

// Bedroom/bathroom matching
if (query includes "X bedroom") → filter by bedrooms >= X
if (query includes "X bath") → filter by bathrooms >= X

// General text search
return searchableText.includes(query);
```
