# Notification System Setup Guide

## üéâ Complete Automatic Notification System

Your notification system is now **fully automated**! Notifications will be created automatically for all major events.

---

## üìã What's Been Set Up

### 1. ‚úÖ Service Layer Notifications
Notifications are automatically created in these services:

#### **AppointmentService** (`src/services/appointmentService.ts`)
- ‚úÖ New appointment scheduled ‚Üí Notifies buyer
- ‚úÖ Appointment confirmed ‚Üí Notifies buyer
- ‚úÖ Appointment cancelled ‚Üí Notifies buyer

#### **PropertyAlertService** (`src/services/propertyAlertService.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Property matches buyer criteria ‚Üí Notifies buyer with match details

### 2. ‚úÖ Database Triggers (Automatic)
These triggers run automatically in the database:

#### **New Messages** (`notify_new_message()`)
- Triggers when: New message inserted
- Notifies: The receiver (opposite of sender)
- Type: `new_message`

#### **Inquiry Responses** (`notify_inquiry_response()`)
- Triggers when: Inquiry status changes to 'responded'
- Notifies: The buyer who made the inquiry
- Type: `inquiry_response`

#### **Price Changes** (`notify_price_change()`)
- Triggers when: Property price is updated
- Notifies: All buyers who favorited the property
- Type: `price_change`

#### **Property Sold** (`notify_property_sold()`)
- Triggers when: Property is marked as sold
- Notifies: All buyers who favorited or inquired
- Type: `property_sold`

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migrations

You need to run **2 migration files** in order:

```bash
# Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)
supabase db push

# Option 2: Manual in Supabase Dashboard
# Go to SQL Editor and run these files in order:
# 1. supabase/migrations/20240101000000_create_notifications_table.sql
# 2. supabase/migrations/20240102000000_create_notification_triggers.sql
```

### Step 2: Enable Realtime for Notifications Table

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** ‚Üí **Database** ‚Üí **Replication**
2. Find the `notifications` table
3. Enable replication
4. Select all operations: **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Test the System

The system is ready! Test it by:

1. **Send a message** ‚Üí Receiver gets notification
2. **Create an appointment** ‚Üí Buyer gets notification
3. **Change a property price** ‚Üí Favorited buyers get notification
4. **Mark property as sold** ‚Üí Interested buyers get notification

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Cleanup Old Notifications

Run this periodically (e.g., weekly cron job):

```sql
SELECT cleanup_old_notifications();
```

This removes:
- Read notifications older than 30 days
- Unread notifications older than 90 days

### Monitor Notification Volume

```sql
-- Check notification stats
SELECT 
  type,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE read = false) as unread
FROM notifications
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY type
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing?

1. **Check migrations ran successfully**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM notifications LIMIT 10;
   ```

2. **Check realtime is enabled**
   - Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Replication
   - Verify `notifications` table is enabled

3. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Look for WebSocket connection errors
   - Check for authentication issues

4. **Test with synthetic notifications**
   - These work without database setup
   - If synthetic works but real doesn't ‚Üí database issue

### Triggers Not Firing?

```sql
-- Check if triggers exist
SELECT 
  trigger_name, 
  event_manipulation, 
  event_object_table
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public'
  AND trigger_name LIKE '%notification%';
```

### Too Many Notifications?

Adjust trigger conditions in migration file:
- Add more filters to `WHEN` clauses
- Limit notification frequency per user
- Add user preference checks
